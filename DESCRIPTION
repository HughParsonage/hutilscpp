           role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: Provides utility functions that are simply, frequently used, 
    but may require higher performance that what can be obtained from base R.
    Incidentally provides support for 'reverse geocoding', such as matching a point
    with its nearest neighbour in another array. Used as a complement to package
    'hutils' by sacrificing compilation or installation time for higher running 
    speeds. The name is a portmanteau of the author and 'Rcpp'.
