Title: Miscellaneous Functions in C++
Version: 0.5.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Hugh",
           family = "Parsonage",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "hugh.parsonage@gmail.com")
Description: Provides utility functions that are simply, frequently used, 
    but may require higher performance that what can be obtained from base R.
    Incidentally provides support for 'reverse geocoding', such as matching a point
    with its nearest neighbour in another array. Used as a complement to package
    'hutils' by sacrificing compilation or installation time for higher running 
    speeds. The name is a portmanteau of the author and 'Rcpp'.
