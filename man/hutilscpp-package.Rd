\title{hutilscpp: Miscellaneous Functions in C++}
\description{
Provides utility functions that are simply, frequently used, but may require higher performance that what can be obtained from base R. Incidentally provides support for 'reverse geocoding', such as matching a point with its nearest neighbour in another array. Used as a complement to package 'hutils' by sacrificing compilation or installation time for higher running speeds. The name is a portmanteau of the author and 'Rcpp'.
